  <!-- Doctype declaration is fine. You are missing the <head> section (and within it, the required <title> element, that marks your page with a title, used by Google and browsers, crucial to valid and findable web pages) that is required before the opening <body> tag. I will add it in with other comments and corrections so you can see the change when I issue a pull request to you. Always run your html past the HTML Validator at https://validator.w3.org and you can then ensure that your markup is valid.  -->
